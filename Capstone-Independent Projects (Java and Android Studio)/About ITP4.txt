About ITP 4

- I created an application using Android Studio that returns a parsed JSON response

- A user enters a number. When the user clicks the "Translate" button, it grabs the current number that the user inputed and sends a POST
request to the magic number generator API that is used. 

- The API has two parameters:
1. My Team number, which is hardcoded
2. The number that is inputted by the user

- The API then returns a JSON response that is parsed
