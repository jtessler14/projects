About ITP 3

- I created an application using Android Studio that functions as a basic calculator with buttons and a display

- This isn't an ordinary calculator though. If the characters in ones username (displayed below the calc.) are even, then only the even
buttons are displayed. If the characters are odd, then only the odd numbers are displayed.

- If the username starts with a letter A through M, the addition and division buttons will be shown but the subtraction and multiplication 
buttons will not be shown. Vice versa for letters N through Z.
